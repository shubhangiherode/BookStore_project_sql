# Bookstore Management System (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Bookstore Management System is a database-driven project developed using PostgreSQL.  
It focuses on designing a relational database, importing book data, and performing various SQL operations for data management and analysis.

This project demonstrates practical SQL skills such as table creation, data insertion, querying, and handling real-world database issues.

## 🔍 SQL Queries Implemented
Using the above datasets, the following queries are implemented:

- Retrieve all books available in the store
- Find customers who placed orders
- Display order details with customer and book information (JOINs)
- Calculate total sales and revenue
- Find top-selling books
- Group and filter data using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Perform CRUD operations on tables

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Create a new database in PostgreSQL.
2. Execute `schema.sql` to create tables.
3. Import CSV files (`Books.csv`, `Customers.csv`, `Orders.csv`) using **pgAdmin Import/Export Tool**.
4. Execute `queries.sql` to run SQL queries.
